# SeSRDQN

SeSRDQN (**S**elf-**E**xplaining **S**kill **R**ecommendation **D**eep **Q**-**N**etwork) is designed based on our previous work ([SkillRec](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442381.3449985)). Here, we focus on building a self-explaining and wellperforming deep reinforcement learning model to reveal the inner decision-making process of skill recommendation.

## Requirements
> python >= 3.8.18 \
> [nvidia-tensorflow](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorflow) == 1.15.5+nv22.08 \
> pandas >= 2.0.3 \
> scikit-learn >= 1.3.0 \
> jieba >= 0.42.1 \
> matplotlib >= 3.7.2 \
> numpy >= 1.24.3 \
> seaborn >= 0.12.2

## Dataset Description
In this work, we conduct experiments on a real-world [job posting dataset](https://codeocean.com/capsule/7695173/tree/v2). The data is collected from a popular online recruitment website, namely [Lagou](https://www.lagou.com/). The dataset contains over 800,000 postings of various job positions across a
time span of 36 months, ranging from July 2016 to June 2019. We first applied *Jieba* to perform word segmentation on the job descriptions and filtered the n-grams with high appearing frequencies. After manually selecting and merging the words, we got 987 IT-related job skills. To reduce noise, we filtered out the job postings containing less than 10 skills and got 805,182 job postings in total.

We provide an example of job postings as follows. You can collect your own datasets and run our code.
